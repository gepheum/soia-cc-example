# Soia C++ examples

## Getting started

### Install NodeJS and bazel

If you use homebrew:

```
brew install node
brew install bazel
```

The soia compiler runs on NodeJS.

This example uses Bazel as a layer on top of your compiler for building and running the C++ code as well as a C++ dependency manager.
